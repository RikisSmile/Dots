/* Sorry for bad english */ 

Based on ML4W Dots
So. My personal dots. 

Repo should contain:

 -- Scipt that install the pakgs; move config into the /home/{user}/.config location

 -- Scrip should be based on python (https://github.com/peakwinter/python-pacman)

-- config folder (contain the all config)

TODO: implement all this shit
